            <h1>Mohanlal Viswanathan</h1>
            <p>Mohanlal Viswanathan was born in the village of Elanthoor in the Pathanamthitta district, Kerala on 21 May 1960. He is the youngest child of Viswanathan Nair, a former bureaucrat and Law Secretary with the Kerala government, and Santhakumari.[24][25] He had an elder brother named Pyarelal (died in 2000, during a military exercise).[26] Mohanlal was named by his maternal uncle Gopinathan Nair, who initially decided to name him Roshanlal before choosing "Mohanlal". However, his father avoided giving him their surname. His father was adamant that he should not bear their caste name (Nair) as surname which they all had.[27] Mohanlal grew up in Mudavanmugal at his paternal home in Thiruvananthapuram. He studied at Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School, Thiruvananthapuram and graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Mahatma Gandhi College, Thiruvananthapuram.[28][29] Mohanlal's first role was as a sixth grader for a stage play called Computer Boy, in which he played a ninety-year-old man.</p>
