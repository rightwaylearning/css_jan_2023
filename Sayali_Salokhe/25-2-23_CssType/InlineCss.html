            The word Kashmir is thought to have been derived from Sanskrit and was referred to as 
            káśmīra.[9] A popular local etymology of Kashmira is that it is land desiccated from water.[10]
            An alternative etymology derives the name from the name of the Vedic sage Kashyapa who is believed to have settled people in this land. Accordingly, Kashmir would
            be derived from either kashyapa-mir (Kashyapa's Lake) or kashyapa-meru (Kashyapa's Mountain).[10]The word Kashmir is thought to have been derived from Sanskrit and was referred to as káśmīra.[9] A popular local etymology of Kashmira is that it is land desiccated from water.[10]
