        <h3>Drishyam 2</h3>
        <p>On the night of 3 October 2014, a man named David Braganza flees from authorities for murder. While hiding behind an under-construction police station, he sees Vijay emerging from it. David later tries to escape with his wife and son but ends up getting arrested.

            Seven years later, Vijay, Nandini, Anju and Anu are living contentedly. Vijay is now a affluent businessman who owns a movie theatre and still operates a cable company. He aspires to make a film of his own and is in frequent contact with screenwriter Murad Ali to develop the script. Anju, on the other hand, is a PTSD patient and has recurring episodes of epilepsy, a result of her involvement in Sam's death. Jealous of the family, a number of locals have resorted to spreading rumours about Anju being in a relationship with Sam, much to Nandini's distress. Her only solace is her friendly neighbor, Jenny, who is frequently abused by her alcoholic husband, Shiv.
            
            On Sam's death anniversary, Vijay has an encounter with Sam's father Mahesh, who vainly asks him to disclose the location of his son's remains. Meanwhile, Nandini spends more time with Jenny and inadvertently reveals that Anju murdered Sam. Unknown to her, Jenny and Shiv are married undercover cops, assigned by Inspector-general of police Tarun Ahlawat, who is a close friend and colleague of Meera.
            
            At the same time, David is released from jail. After struggling to reconcile with his now-estranged wife, he yearns to find employment. While coming to know that Vijay's case is still progressing, he recalls the latter's presence at the then-under-construction police station and realizes that Vijay was in fact complicit within the murder. He tips Tarun, who summons Meera and Mahesh from London. After the trio bribes him, David divulges what he saw, leading to the newly-built police station being unearthed. The police eventually discover a skeleton. Vijay, having noticed this through his CCTV cameras which he had installed around the police station, seemingly gives up.</p>
