    <p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the country's cricket governing body,[11] is headquartered at Cricket centre at Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai.[12] The BCCI is the richest cricket governing body in the world and is part of the "Big Three" of international cricket, along with Cricket Australia and the England and Wales Cricket Board.[13][14]

        The BCCI was formed in December 1928 and is a consortium of state cricket associations that select their own representatives who elect the BCCI president. Grant Govan was the first BCCI president and Anthony De Mello was its first secretary.[15] As of February 2023, Roger Binny is the incumbent BCCI president and Jay Shah is secretary.[16][17] The board joined the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1926.[1] The BCCI is an autonomous, private organisation that does not fall under the purview of the National Sports Federation of India and the Government of India has minimal regulation of it. The BCCI is influential in international cricket.[18][19][20] As such, it does not receive any grants or funds from the Ministry of Sports.
