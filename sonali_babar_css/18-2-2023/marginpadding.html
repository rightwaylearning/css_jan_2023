Widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time,[3] Kohli holds the record for scoring most runs in both T20 internationals and in IPL. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him as player of decade. Kohli has also contributed to India's successes, including winning the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy.

During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs scored in the tournament. In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone, becoming the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. His form continued in 2019, where he became the first player to score 20,000 international runs in single decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step down as the captain of the Indian national team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and
