      <p id="p1">n the first half of the first millennium, the Kashmir region became an important centre of 
        Hinduism and later of Buddhism. During the 7th-14th centuries, the region was ruled by a 
        series of Hindu dynasties,[22] and Kashmir Shaivism arose.[23] In 1339, Shah Mir became 
        the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, inaugurating the Salatin-i-Kashmir or Shah Mir dynasty.[4] The region was part of the Mughal Empire from 1586 to 1751,[24] 
        and thereafter, until 1820, of the Afghan Durrani Empire.[4]</p>
