        <p class="class1">Kashmir (IPA:  is the northernmost geographical region of the Indian subcontinent. 
            Until the mid-19th century, the term "Kashmir"<h4> denoted only the Kashmir Valley</h4> between the Great 
            Himalayas and the Pir Panjal Range.Today, the term encompasses a larger area that includes the
            India-administered territories of Jammu <h2>and Kashmir and Ladakh</h2>, the Pakistan-administered 
            territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and the Chinese-administered territories of
             Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract.[1][2][3]In 1820, the Sikh Empire, under Ranjit 
             Singh, annexed Kashmir.[4] In 1846, after the Sikh defeat in the First Anglo-Sikh War, 
             and upon the purchase of the region from the British under the Treaty of Amritsar, the 
             Raja of Jammu, Gulab Singh, became the new ruler of Kashmir. The rule of his descendants, under the paramountcy (or tutelage[5][6]) of the British Crown, lasted until the Partition of India in 1947, when the former princely state of the British Indian Empire became a disputed territory, 
            now administered by three countries: China, India, and Pakistan.[1][7][8][2]
