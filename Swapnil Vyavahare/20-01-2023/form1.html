        <h3>Sachin Tendulkar</h3>
        <p>
            Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar BR (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ (listen); pronounced [sət͡ʃin t̪eːɳɖulkəɾ]; born 24 April
            1973) is an Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national team. He is regarded as
            one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[4] He is the all-time highest run-scorer in both ODI
            and Test cricket with more than 18000 runs and 15000 runs respectively in total.[5] He also holds the record
            for receiving the most man-of-the-match awards in international cricket.[6] Known for his large fanbase and
            described by ESPNcricinfo as 'the most worshipped player in the world'.[7]

            Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match debut on 15 November 1989 against
            Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India
            internationally for close to twenty-four years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the
            second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all
            time, behind Viv Richards.[8] Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the 2011
            Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[9] He had previously been named
            "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament.

            Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievements, the Khel Ratna Award,
            India's highest sporting honour, in 1997, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008,
            respectively, two of India's highest civilian awards.[10][11] A few hours after the end of his last match in
            November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's
            highest civilian award.[12][13] As of 2021, he is the youngest recipient to date and was the first
            sportsperson to receive the award.[14][15] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper
            house of the Parliament of India.[16]

            In 2010, Time magazine included Tendulkar in its annual Time 100 list as one of the most influential people
            in the world.[17] Tendulkar was awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the 2010
            ICC Awards.[18] Having retired from ODI cricket in 2012,[19][20] he retired from all forms of cricket in
            November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match.[21] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in
            total, scoring 34,357 runs.[22] In 2013, Tendulkar was included in an all-time Test World XI compiled in
            2013 to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and he was the only specialist batsman of
            the post–World War II era, along with Viv Richards, to get featured in the team.[23] In 2019 he was inducted
            into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.
